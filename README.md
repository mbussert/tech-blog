## Usage:

Once a user creates an account/registers, they are taken to their personal dashboard where they can see all of their posts. The available links in the navigation bar also swap over now that the user is logged in. The user may edit or delete only their posts. The edit modal is pre-populated with the post information so that the user does not have to copy & paste or retype the entire post. A user will be automatically logged out if left inactive for 5 minutes.
